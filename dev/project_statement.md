*An open-source documentation browser designed specifically for AI-assisted development workflows*

## Problem Statement

AI-assisted developers using tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and other AI coding assistants face a critical workflow friction: **the documentation access overhead problem**. As projects grow and AI workflows become more sophisticated, the need for rapid documentation verification and context gathering increases exponentially, but traditional solutions become increasingly cumbersome.

**The Documentation Access Overhead Problem:**
- **Project Setup Phase**: Need to quickly review 5-10+ documentation files to provide AI context, but VS Code's 3-8 second startup time and 200-500MB memory usage creates tab chaos and management overhead
- **Verification Phase**: After AI completes features, need lightweight access to verify against documented standards, but current tools require 5-10 minute context switching disruptions
- **Scaling Burden**: As documentation volume grows, traditional editors become increasingly heavyweight for simple "read and verify" tasks, with performance degrading proportionally to file count
- **Workflow Disruption**: Context switching from terminal-based AI tools to heavyweight editors (VS Code: 200-500MB, 3-8s startup) kills development momentum and breaks flow state

**Current Solution Failures:**
- **VS Code**: Heavyweight (200-500MB memory, 3-8s startup), edit-centric, tab management overhead scales poorly with documentation volume
- **Grip**: Rate limits (60/hour), requires internet, single-file focus insufficient for multi-document verification
- **Basic HTTP Server**: No rendering, downloads files instead of displaying, unusable for actual documentation review
- **Static Site Generators**: Build overhead (30s-2min) incompatible with rapid verification needs

## Solution Overview

A lightweight, open-source web-based documentation explorer specifically optimized for AI-assisted development workflows, running locally at `http://localhost:5000`. VeriDoc prioritizes rapid verification, minimal overhead, and seamless integration with terminal-based AI development tools.

VeriDoc fills the gap between heavyweight development environments and basic file serving - creating the first tool specifically designed for the documentation verification patterns that define modern AI-assisted development.

### Primary Persona: AI-Assisted Solo Developer
**Characteristics**: Uses AI coding assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI) for rapid development, builds MVPs and prototypes, needs frequent documentation verification, works in terminal-centric environments, experiences increasing friction as project documentation grows.

### Core User Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Project Setup & Initial AI Context (High Documentation Access)
**Context**: Starting a new MVP with Claude Code. Need to quickly review multiple documentation files (architecture.md, api-specs.md, guidelines.md) to understand project structure before providing initial context to AI.

**Current Pain**: Opening 5-10+ documentation files in VS Code creates tab chaos and management overhead. Need rapid overview of project documentation structure without editor bloat.

**Solution**: 
```bash
$ veridoc .
# Clean sidebar shows all documentation files
# Click through multiple docs quickly in one interface
# Fast project documentation overview without overhead
```

#### Scenario 2: Post-Development Verification (Focused Documentation Review)
**Context**: AI assistant completed a feature implementation. Need to verify output against documented standards, architecture decisions, and API specifications.

**Current Pain**: Need lightweight access to specific documentation files for verification. Breaking out of terminal workflow is disruptive. Current tools require too much setup for quick verification.

**Solution**:
```bash
# AI completed user authentication feature
$ veridoc docs/security-guidelines.md
$ veridoc docs/api-design.md
# Quick verification without leaving terminal context
```

#### Scenario 3: Growing Documentation Burden (Scaling Problem)
**Context**: As project grows, accumulated documentation files create increasing overhead. Traditional editors become heavyweight for simple "read and verify" tasks.

**Current Pain**: VS Code becomes cumbersome as documentation volume increases. File management overhead scales poorly. Need solution that stays lightweight regardless of documentation size.

**Solution**: Dedicated documentation interface optimized for browsing that maintains performance regardless of project documentation volume.

### Backend Server
**Technology Stack**: Python Flask/FastAPI or Node.js Express
**Core Responsibilities**: File system access, security validation, terminal proxy

#### API Endpoints

**File System APIs:**
- `GET /api/files?path=<relative_path>` - Directory listings with metadata
- `GET /api/file_content?path=<file_path>&page=<n>&lines_per_page=<count>` - Paginated file content
- `WebSocket /api/terminal` - Interactive terminal proxy

**Security Model:**
- All file access restricted to `BASE_PATH` (server launch directory)
- Path traversal prevention with explicit symbolic link rejection
- Input validation for all API parameters
- Terminal commands logged to `./logs/server.log`

**Performance Specifications:**
- Directory listings: < 200ms response time
- File content loading: < 500ms for files up to 10MB
- Memory usage: < 50MB baseline, < 100MB with active terminal sessions

### Frontend Application
**Technology Stack**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
**Core Components**: Two-pane layout, content renderer, integrated terminal

#### User Interface

**Layout:**
- **Left Sidebar**: Expandable file tree with manual refresh capability
- **Main Viewer**: Content display area with rendering controls
- **Integrated Terminal**: `xterm.js`-based terminal with copy/paste support

   - `.md` with rich formatting, tables, code blocks, and math support
   - `.mmd` with interactive Mermaid diagrams
   - `.txt` and basic text files
2. **Tier 2**: 
   - `.json`, `.yaml`, `.xml` (configuration files)
   - `.py`, `.js`, `.sh` (code with syntax highlighting)
   - `.csv` (tabular data)
3. **Tier 3**: 
   - Images, binary file detection
   - Additional programming languages

**File Size Handling:**
- Files > 1MB: Paginated at 1000 lines per page
- Files > 10MB: Warning prompt before loading
- Files > 50MB: Rejected with alternative suggestions

#### URL Navigation
- `/?path=<file_path>&line=<line_number>` - Direct file/line access
- Graceful fallback to directory view on invalid paths
- Browser history support for navigation

## CLI Integration
